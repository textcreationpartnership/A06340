            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Not long ſince (right Honorable) I happened to trauayle from the famous Cittie of <hi>Tolledo</hi> in <hi>Spayne,</hi> tovvarde highe
<hi>Castile,</hi> and by fortune ouertooke an auncient Gentlemen, vvorſhipfully accompanied, vnto vvho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I vvas ſo bold as to approch, beſeching his vvorſhip to aduertiſe me of his iourney: vvho (after he had beheld my white head &amp; beard) anſvvered ful<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gentlely, that his inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vvas to trauayle vnto the king <pb facs="tcp:9400:3"/>of Spaynes Court, and vvelcomed me vnto his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.

You ſhall vnderſtande, that I am a Gentleman of lxx. yeares of age, and ſometimes I ſerued in the ciuill vvarres of <hi>Pirru,</hi> vvhere I vvas vvounded in diuers parts of my body, and am novv thereby lame in one of my legges and ſhoulder.

But al this notvvithſtanding, I do novv ſue vnto the Kings Maieſtie, to haue licence and authoritie to diſcouer and conquere a certayne parte of <hi>India,</hi> vvhyche adioyneth vvith <hi>Brazile,</hi> and is part of the Empire of <hi>Pirru,</hi> I pray you novve declare what you thinke of my ſute.

Then (quoth I) my opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, that you are not wel in your wit, for vvhat vvould you haue? vvil not reaſon ſuffice you? or elſe would you now in your old days be an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, <pb facs="tcp:9400:4"/>conſidering that your Sepulchre attendeth for you, Novve truly I thanke you (quoth he) for of youre iudgement are moſt men: but I ſay vnto you, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that all fleſh muſt finiſh, I ſeeke for no quiet reſt in this tranſitorie life: yea the vviſe and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Doctors do teach and admoniſh, that euery true Chriſtian is borne, not for his ovvne priuate vvealth and pleaſure, but rather to help and ſuccoure others his poore breethren. Likevviſe doe I conſider the greate number of Gentlemen, yonger brethren, and other valia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t perſons, vvho through vvant of liuing, do fall into many diſorders. VVherefore to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh my dutie tovvard God and my Prince, and to releeue ſuch poore Gentlemen, do I novv attempte this iourney, vvith the aduenture of my bodye and goodes, and for that purpoſe I haue in readineſſe foure tall Shippes, vvell furniſhed in the porte of <hi>Saint Lucar de Barrameda,</hi> hoping aſſuredlye, that before the life depart from my body, to heare theſe valiante yong Gentlemen (vvhome novv I meane to haue in my company) ſay, oh happie day, vvhen olde
<hi>Zarate</hi> (for ſo is my name) broughte vs from penurie, yea and from a number of perils that vve vvere like to fall into. I hope alſo, that the royall eſtate of my Prince ſhall be by my paynes and poore ſeruice en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged: beleeue you me, this is the onely ſumptuous Tumbe that I pretende to builde for my poore car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kas. But yet I knovv there are ſome, vnto vvhome I may compare the Bore that lyeth vvallovvyng in his Stye, vvho vvill not lette to ſaye, vvhat neede vve any other vvorld, honor, or Kingdomes? let vs

VVith this concluſion the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ended his tale, the iudgement vvhereof I leaue to noble Gentlemen his peeres to be determined.</p>
            <p>And vvhere oure Captayne <hi>Hernando Cortez,</hi> of vvhoſe valiant actes this hiſtorie treateth, hathe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued immortal fame, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo doubtleſſe I hope, that vvithin this happie Realme is novv liuing a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, vvhoſe zeale of trauayle and valiant begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings dothe prognoſticate greate, maruellous, and happie ſucceſſe: for perfection of honor and profite is not gotten in one daye, nor in one or tvvo voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as the true hiſtories of the Eaſt and VVeſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts by Spanyardes and Portingalles do teſtifye.

And vvhere I for my parte haue taſted of your honors goodneſſe ſundrye vvayes, I am novve moſt humbly to beſeech youre honor to accept this poore gifte, the vvhiche I haue tranſlated out of the Spaniſh tong, not decked vvith gallant couloures, nor yet fyled vvith pleaſant phraſe <pb facs="tcp:9400:5"/>of Rhetorike, for theſe things are not for poore Marchant trauellers, but are reſerued to learned VVriters: yet I truſt the Author vvill pardon mee, bycauſe I haue gone as neere the ſenſe of this Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as my cunning vvoulde reach vnto. I alſo craue, that it may pleaſe youre honor, vvhen your greate and vvaightie buſineſſe vvill permitte, to beholde this vvorke, and that ſhall be for me an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente to take in hande the tranſlation of the Eaſt

            <p>In thys hiſtorie doth appeare the ſimplicitie of thoſe ignorant <hi>Indians</hi> in time paſt, yea and how they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded in worſhipping Idolles and wicked <hi>Mamon,</hi> their bloudy ſlaughter of men in ſacrifice, and now the greate mercie of Ieſus Chriſt extended vpon them in lightning their darkeneſſe, giuing them knowledge of the eternitie, and holy trinitie in vnitie, whereby they are nowe more deuoute vnto heauenly things than we wretched Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, <pb facs="tcp:9400:6"/>(who preſume of auntiente Chriſtianitie) eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallye in Charitie, humilitie, and liuely workes of faith.</p>

His mother was of inclination deuoute, but ſomewhat harde: his father was charitable and mercyfull, who in his youth applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the warres, and was Liuetenant to a company of horſemen. <hi>Hernando Cortez</hi> in his childehood was very ſickely, ſo that many tymes he was at the poynt of death: And when he came to .xiiij. yéeres of age, his parents ſent him to the Vniuerſitie of <hi>Salamanca,</hi> where he remayned twoo yeares, learnyng Grammar, and then returned to <hi>Medellin</hi> werie of his ſtudie, yea poſſible for want of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: yet his pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts were much offended with him for lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his ſtudie, for theyr onely deſire was to haue had

And at that inſtant happened two iorneys fit for his purpoſe &amp; inclination. The one of them was to <hi>Naples</hi> wyth <hi>Gonſalo Hernandez</hi> of the Citie of <hi>Cordoua,</hi> who was a worthy man, &amp; named the great captaine. And the other iourney was to the Weaſt India, with the Lorde

And likewiſe the great deſire of gold made him to couet that voyage more than the Iorney vnto <hi>Naples.</hi> Now in the meane while that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleet was preparing for <hi>India,</hi> it chaunced, <hi>Hernando Cartez</hi> pretended to go vnto a certaine houſe in the night ſeaſon to talke with a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and clyming ouer a Wall whyche was of weake foundation, both he and the Wal fell togither: So that with the noyſe of hys fall, and ratling of his armoure which he ware, came out a man newly married, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng him fallen at hys dore would haue ſlayne hym, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting ſomewhat of his newe married wife, but that a certaine olde woman (being his mother in lawe) wyth great perſwaſions ſtayed him from that fact. Yet with the fall he fell into a grieuous Ague, and continued ſicke for a long ſeaſon, ſo that he could not procéede vppon his voyage with the gouernour <hi>Ouando.</hi> And when he had obtained and fullye recouered his health, he mynded to paſſe into <hi>Italy,</hi> And ſo toke hys way towarde <hi>Valentia,</hi>

<hi>Valaſques</hi> prepared a Caruel, and therein ſent one <hi>Chriſtofer de Olid,</hi> for to ſéeke <hi>Grijalua</hi> with ſuccor if néed wer, and gaue <hi>Olid</hi> great charge, that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne with newes from <hi>Grijalua</hi> with all ſpéede: But this meſſenger taried but a ſmall while vpon his voyage, and ſaw but little of <hi>Yucatan,</hi> and not fynding <hi>Grijalua,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned backe againe to <hi>Cuba,</hi> which returne happed not wel for the gouernour nor yet for <hi>Grijalua.</hi> For if he had procéeded for the on his way to Saint <hi>Iohn de Vlhua,</hi> hee had then mette with whom he ſought for, and likewiſe cauſed him to haue inhabited there. But he excuſed him ſelf, alleaging that he had loſt his ankers, and was ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore forced of neceſſitie to returne.</p>
               <p>And as ſoone as <hi>Olid</hi> was departed on that voyage,
<hi>Pedro de Aluarado</hi> returned to <hi>Cuba,</hi> wyth full relation of the diſcouerie, &amp; brought many things w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hym, wrought in gold, with ſtrange coloured feathers, and cotton wool. The gouernour <hi>Iames Valaſques</hi> reioyced much to behold thoſe principles: And all the Spaniardes of <hi>Cuba</hi> wondered therat, and likewiſe to heare the whole relatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the iourney. Yet the gouernour feared the returne of his kinſman, bycauſe ſome of his companye that came ſicke and diſeaſed from thoſe parties, ſaide that <hi>Grijalua</hi> meaned not to inhabite there; and that the people and land was great, and alſo how the ſame people were war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: likewiſe the gouernour feared the wiſedome and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:9400:15"/>courage of his kinſman. Wherevppon he determined to ſend thyther certaine ſhippes, with ſouldiers and armor and other trifling things, thinking chiefly to enrich him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by barter, and alſo to inhabite by force. He requeſted one <hi>Baltazer Vermudez</hi> to take that voyage in hand, who accepted the offer, but he demaunded thrée thouſand duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets for his furniture and prouiſion. Their gouernour hearing this demaund, anſwered, that in ſuche ſorte the charges would be more than the profite: And ſo for that tyme lefte off the matter, bycauſe he was couetous, and loth to ſpend, thinking to prouide an army at other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s coſt, as he had done before, when <hi>Grijalua</hi> went firſte on that voyage, for at that time one <hi>Franciſco de Montezo</hi> did furniſh one ſhippe.

But for as much as that was the Sabboth daye, they determined to heare diuine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and after dinner to make ſaile. When their ſeruice was ended, and <hi>Cortez</hi> fitting at his meate, there was newes brought him that a little veſſell called a <hi>Canoa,</hi> came vnder ſaile toward the ſhippes, whiche ſeemed to come from <hi>Yucatan:</hi> with that newes

And then he began to ſpeake in the Spaniſh tongue in thys wiſe: Maiſters are ye Chriſtians, yea (quoth they) and of the Spaniſh nation. Then he reioyced ſo much, that the teares fell from his eyes, and demaunded of them what day it was, although he had a Primer wherein he dayly prayed.</p>
               <p>He then beſought them earneſtlye to aſſiſt him with their prayers &amp; thankſgiuing vnto god for his deliuery, &amp; kneling deuoutly downe vppon his knees, holding vp his handes, his eyes toward heauen, and his face bathed <pb n="33" facs="tcp:9400:23"/>with teares, made his humble prayer vnto God, giuing moſt hartie thankes, that it hadde pleaſed hym to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer him out of the power of Infidels and infernal crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to place hym among Chriſtians and men of his owne nation. <hi>Andrew de Tapia</hi> holpe hym vppe, and toke hym in hys armes,

<hi>Geronimo de Aguilar,</hi> I was borne in the Cittie of <hi>Eſifa</hi> in the <hi>Andolozia,</hi> and by miſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune I was loſte after this ſorte. In the warres of <hi>Darien</hi> and in the time of the contentions and paſſions of <hi>Iames de Nicueſſa,</hi> and <hi>Vaſco Nonez Balboa,</hi> I came with Captaine <hi>Valdinia</hi> in a little Caruell, toward
<hi>Santo Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo,</hi> to giue aduice to the Admirall and gouernour, of the troubles which had happned, and my comming was for men and victuals: and likewiſe we brought twentye thouſand Duckettes of the kings in
<hi>Anno.</hi> 15 11. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we apported at <hi>Iamayca,</hi> our Caruel was loſt on the ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes whiche were called the Vipars, and with greate pain we entred (about twenty perſons) into the boate, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> out ſayle, water or bread, and weake prouiſion of oares: we thus wander thirtéene or fourtéene dayes, and then the currant, whiche is there very great &amp; runneth alway weaſtward, caſt vs a ſhoare in a prouince called

And for to eſcape ſuche abhominable death, we brake the priſon and fledde through certaine mountaines: So that it pleaſed God that wee mette with another

And if with this warning they would not departe, they meante to kyl both him and as many as were with him. Yet <hi>Cortez</hi> ceaſſed not to vſe all humanitie with thoſe barbarous people, according to the commaundemente and inſtructions giuen vnto him by the King of <hi>Caſtill,</hi> whiche was, to require thoſe people oftentimes with peace, before the attempting of warre, or entring per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force into their Townes and Countrey, ſo that yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne

But when the Company that lay in ambuſh

<note place="margin">The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvere of the Cacike.</note> And laſt of all to giue them knowledge of the faith of Ieſu Chriſt.</p>
               <p>As touching Sir (quoth he) the Mynes of gold and ſiluer in our country, we ſéeke for none, for we ſéeke not after treaſure and riches, but we procure and deſire a quiet life.

Then <hi>Cortez</hi> willed them to put all feare aſide, and tolde them that he with his ſmall company woulde goe vnto their Cittie to viſite their Lorde, and to be acquaynted with him: the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> ſayde, that the day was farre ſpent, and that it was late to goe that night to
<hi>Zempoallan,</hi> but if it pleaſed hym they would conduct him to a village whiche ſtoode on the otherſide of the Riuer and within ſight, and although it were but a ſmall village, yet there was reaſonable lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with meate ſufficiente for his armie: their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell ſéemed well, ſo they wente to that village, and when they were comen thither, the
<hi>Indians</hi> craued licence to goe &amp; to aduertife their Lorde how the ſtraungers abode in that place, promiſing to returne the nexte day with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. Some of the <hi>Indians</hi> had licence to do the meſſage, the others abode there, attendyng and prouiding for the newe geſtes, &amp; in this order they were al lodged and their ſupper abundantly prouided. That night <hi>Cortez</hi> fortified himſelfe as ſtrong as mought be, and the nexte morning came a hundreth men laden with Hennes, ſaying that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:9400:44"/>their Lord much reioyced of their comming, and bicauſe he was ſo groſſe and vnwealdie, he came not perſonallye vnto him, but yet notwithſtanding he aboade in the cittie expecting his comming.
<hi>Cortez</hi> friendly welcomed them, and with that preſente, he and his company brake their faſte, and then proceeded with his guives in good order with two fauconets in readineſſe, if néede ſhould happen: and from that paſſage of the riuer they had a faire way vntil they came to another riuer, which being likewiſe waded ouer, they diſcried <hi>Zempoallan,</hi> whiche ſtoode a myle diſtant from them, all beſet wyth fayre Orchardes and Gardens, verye pleaſaunte to beholde: they vſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to water them with ſluſes when they pleaſed.</p>
               <p>There procéeded out of the Towne many perſons, to behold and receyue ſo ſtrange a people vnto them. They came with ſmiling countenance, and preſented vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diuers kinde of Floures, and ſundry fruites, which none of our menne had héeretofore ſéene. Theſe people came without feare among the Ordinance, with this pompe, triumph and ioy they were receiued into the Citie, which ſéemed a beautifull Garden: for the trées were ſo gréene and high, that ſcarſely the houſes appeared.</p>
               <p>At the Citie gate ſtoode many graue perſons of nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, as Magiſtrates of the Citie, who ſolemnely welco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Strangers.

               <p>Within this great houſe was a long rew of lodgings, and on the other ſide ſixe or ſeuen Towers one higher than another.

               <p>The Counſell and magiſtrates of <hi>Vera Crux</hi> wrote

               <p>The cauſe why the generaltye had written theſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters was, ſuſpecting <hi>Iames Velaſques,</hi> who had frends and great fauour in the Court and counſel of <hi>Indias,</hi> and alſo ſome ſecrete friendes in <hi>Cortez</hi> his campe.

<note place="margin">A famous facte.</note> and to the intent that they ſhould all follow hym, although againſte their willes, he determined to ſpoyle all his Shyppes, which was a ſtrange caſe, perillous, and a great loſſe.

Nowe theſe myghtie Lords ſéeyng that they were ſo ſtubborne, and woulde not returne with them, departed from them ſore diſpleaſed, ſaying, that he woulde ſende his children that ſhould both rule and gouerne them, in iuſtice, peace, and auntient Religion, and for this conſideration, wée haue alwayes expected and beléeued, that ſuche a people ſhould come to rule and gouerne vs, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering from whence you come, I doe thinke that you are they whome we looked for, and the notice which the greate Emperour

They play not at chaſes, but at ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>die, or at check, that is, if the ball touch the wall it loſeth. They maye ſtrike the ball with any part of their body, but there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a penaltie if they only ſtrike not with the buttoke or ſide, whiche is the fineſt play: wherefore they vſe a ſkynne vpon eache butttocke. They play ſo many to ſo many for a packe of mantels, or according to the abilitie of the players. Alſo they play for golde and feathers, and ſometime for their owne bodyes, as they vſe at <hi>Patolli,</hi> which is there permitted &amp; lawfull. The Tennis Court is called <hi>Tlachco,</hi> and is a Hall long and narrow, but wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vpwards, than downewardes, and higher on the ſides than at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ends, which is an induſtrie for their play. The houſe is always white and ſmooth in the ſide walles: they haue certain ſtones like vnto mylſtones, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a little hole in <pb n="180" facs="tcp:9400:97"/>the middeſt that paſſeth through the ſtone, the hole is ſo ſmall, that ſcarcely the ball maye paſſe through, but hée that chanceth to ſtrike the ball into the hole, whiche ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome happeneth, winneth the game, and by an auntiente lawe and cuſtome among Tennis players, he ought to haue the clokes of all thoſe that ſtande and beholde the play, on that ſide that the ball went in, and in ſome Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis Courtes, the halfe of the garmentes of them that ſtande lookyng on. The winner is then bounde to make certayne ſacrifice to the God of the Tennis play, and to the ſtone where the ball entred.

               <p>They vſed in the Temple of the Tennis play two I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of the God of the ball, which ſtoode vpon the two lower walles. Their Sacrifice was celebrated at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nighte, with many Ceremonies and Witchcraftes, and ſongs for that purpoſe. Then came a Prieſte from the Cathedrall Churche, wyth other Religious perſons to bleſſe the Sacrifice, ſaying certayne diueliſhe prayers, and throwing the ball four tymes in the Tennis Court.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is another houſe with large quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters &amp; lodgings, which is called a houſe for foule, not bycauſe there are more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the other, but bycauſe they bee bigger and to hauke withal, and are foule of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, wherfore they are eſtéemed as more nobler than al the others.</p>
               <p>There are in this houſe many high halles, in the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che are kept men, women and Children: in ſome of them are kept ſuche as are borne white of colour, which doth very ſeldome happen: in other ſome are dwarfes, croke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backes, burſtenmen, counterfaites, and monſtrous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in greate number: they ſay that they vſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them when they were children, to ſette forth the kings greatneſſe: euery of theſe perſons were in ſeuerall Halles by themſelues.</p>
               <p>In the lower Halles were greate Cages made of Tymber: in ſome of them were Lyons, in other Tygres, in other Ownzes, in others Wolues: in concluſion, there was no foure footed beaſte that wanted there, onely to the effect that the mightie <hi>Mutezuma</hi> might ſay that hee had ſuch things in his houſe.</p>
               <p>They were fed with their ordinary, as Gynea cockes, Deare, Dogges, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>There was alſo in other Halles great Earthen veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, ſome with earth, and ſome with water, wherin were ſnakes, as groſſe as a mans thigh, Vipers Crocodrilles, whiche they cal <hi>Caymanes,</hi> or

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:9400:99"/>Serpentes as well of the water as of the land, a terrible fight for the lokers on.</p>
               <p>There were alſo other Cages for foule of rapyne of all ſortes, as Hawkes, Kyghtes, Boyters, and at the leaſt nine or ten kind of Haukes. This houſe of foule had of dayly allowance fiue hundred Gynea cockes, and thrée hundred men of ſeruice, beſides the Falconers and Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which are infinite. There were many other ſortes of Foules that our men knowe not, which ſéemed by theyr beake and talents good to Hauke withal.</p>
               <p>To the Snakes and other venemous beaſtes they gaue the bloude of men ſacrifiſed, to féede them, and ſome ſaye they gaue vnto them mannes fleſhe, whych the greate Lyſarts doe eate very well. The Spaniardes ſaw the floure couered with bloud like a iealy in a ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter houſe, it ſtonke horribly.</p>
               <p>It was ſtraunge to ſée the officers in this houſe howe euery one was occupied. Our men tooke greate pleaſure in beholding ſuche ſtraunge thyngs, but they coulde not awaye wyth the roaryng of the Lyons, the fearefull hiſſing of the Snakes and Adders, the dolefull howling and barking of the Wolues, the ſorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full yelling of the Ownzes &amp; Tigres, when they would haue meate.</p>
               <p>Moſte certaine, in the nighte ſeaſon it ſéemed a Dongeon of Hell, and a dwelling place of the Deuill, and euen ſo it was in déede, for neare at hande was a Hall of a hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred &amp; fiftie foote long, and thirtie foote broad, where was a Chappel with the Roofe of ſiluer and gold in leafe Waineſcotted, and decked with greate ſtore of pearle and ſtone, as Agattes, Cornerines, Emeraldes, Rubies, and diuerſe other ſortes, and thys was the Oratory where <hi>Mutezuma</hi> prayed in the nighte ſeaſon, <pb n="186" facs="tcp:9400:100"/>and in that chappell the Diuell did appeare vnto hym, and gaue him anſwere accordyng to his prayers.</p>
               <p>He had other houſes lyke vnto Barnes, onely for the feathers of foules, and for mantels whiche procéeded of his rentes and tributes, a thing muche to be ſéene: vpon the dores was ſette his armes, whiche was a Connie.</p>
               <p>Here dwelled the chiefe officers of his houſe, as Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorer, Controller, Receyuers and other officers appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng to the Kings reuenewes.
<hi>Mutezuma</hi> had no houſe wherein was not an oratory for the Deuill, whome they worſhipped for the Iewels there. And therefore thoſe houſes were great and large.</p>

The woodde whereof they make their Armour and Targettes, is very harde and ſtrong, for they vſe to toaſte it at the fire, and at their arrowe endes they incloſe a litle péece of flinte ſtone, or a péece of a fiſhe bone called <hi>Libiſa,</hi> and that is venemous, for if any hée hurte therewith and the

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:9400:102"/>called ſlaues, for when they maye haue licence to eate egges, they thinke it a greate fauour. It was reported that they were taxed what they ſhoulde eate, and all the reſidue was taken from them. They went very poorely clothed, yea and the moſt of their treaſure was an earthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> potte, wherein they boyled theyr herbes, a couple of Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones to grinde their Corne, and a matte to lye vppon.

All the aforeſayde rentes they brought to <hi>Mexico</hi> vpon theyr backes and in boates, I meane ſo much as was neceſſary for the prouiſion of the houſe and Courte of

               <p>There were many other prouinces, whiche paid a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne portion, and reknowledged ſeruice, but this tribute was more of honor than profite. In this ſort <hi>Mutezuma</hi> had more than ſufficiente to prouide his houſe &amp; warres, and to heape vp great ſtore in his treaſory.

Likewiſe they were bounde to prouide all the fierwod that ſhould be ſpent in the Court, whiche was a great thing, and did amount to 230. hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred waight a day, which was fiue hundred mens burthens, and ſome dayes in the winter much more. And for the Kings Chimneys they brought the barke of Oke trées, whiche was beſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtéemed for the light thereof, for they were greate ſorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. <hi>Mutezuma</hi> had 100. cities with their prouinces, of whome he receiued rentes, tributes, &amp; vaſſalage, where he mainteined garriſon of ſouldiers, &amp; had treaſorers in each of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

               <p>This Citie is built vpon the water, euen in the ſame order as
<hi>Venice</hi> is. All the body of the Citie ſtandeth in a greate large lake of water. There is thrée ſortes of ſtréetes very broade and fayre, the one ſorte are onely of water, with many bridges, an other ſort of onely earth, and the thirde of earth and water, that is to ſaye, the one halfe earth to walke vpon, and the other halfe for boates to bring prouiſion of all ſorts.

               <p>The water is broughte from thence in two pypes or Canalls in greate quantitie, and when the one is foule, then all the water is conuayed into the other, til the firſt be made cleane. From this fountayne al the whole Citie is prouided, ſo that they goe ſelling the ſame water from ſtréete to ſtréete in little boates, and doe paye a certayne tribute for the ſame.</p>
               <p>This Citie is deuided into two ſtréetes, the one was called <hi>Tlatelulco,</hi> that is to ſay, a litle Iland, and the other
<hi>Mexico,</hi> where <hi>Mutezuma</hi> his dwelling and courte was, &amp; is to be interpreted a ſpring. This ſtréete is the fayreſt and moſt principall, and bycauſe of the Kings pallace there, the Citie was named
<hi>Mexico,</hi> although the old and firſt name of the Citie was
<hi>Tenuchtitlan,</hi> whiche doth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie fruite out of ſtone, for the name is compounded of <hi>Tetl,</hi> which is, ſtone, and <hi>Nuchtli,</hi> which is fruite, called in <hi>Cuba, Tunas.</hi> The trée that beareth this fruite, is named <hi>Nopal,</hi> and is nothing almoſt but leaues of a foote broade and round, and thrée ynches thicke, ſome more, and ſome leſſe, according to the growth, full of thornes whiche are venemous: the leafe is gréene, and the thorne or pricke ruſſet. After that it is planted, it encreaſeth, growing leafe vnto leafe, and the foote thereof commeth to bée as the body of a frée, and one leafe dothe not onely produce another at the poynt, but at the ſides of the ſame leaues procéedeth other leaues: And bycauſe héere in <hi>Spayne</hi> is <pb n="194" facs="tcp:9400:104"/>of the ſame trées and fruite, it néedeth no further deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>In ſome prouinces where water is ſcante, they vſe to drynke the iuice of theſe leaues. The fruite thereof cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Nuchtli,</hi> is lyke vnto fygges, and euen ſo hathe hys little kernels or graynes within, but they are ſomewhat larger, and crowned lyke vnto a Medler. There are of them of ſundrye coloures, ſome are gréene without, and Carnationlike within, which haue a good taſt. Others are yellowe, and others white, and ſome ſpeckled: the beſt ſort are the white: it is a fruite that will laſt long.</p>
               <p>Some of them taſteth of peares, and other ſome of Grapes: it is a colde and a freſh fruite, and beſt eſtéemed in the heate of Sommer. The <hi>Spanyardes</hi> doe more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtéeme them than the

               <p>There is yet another kinde of this fruite redde, and that is nothing eſtéemed, although his taſt is not euill, but bycauſe it dothe coloure and dye the eaters mouth, lippes, and apparell, yea and maketh his vryne looke like pure bloud. Many <hi>Spanyardes</hi> at their firſt comming into <hi>India,</hi> and eating this fruite, were in a maze, and at their wittes ende, thinking that all the bloud in their bodyes came out in vryne: yea and manye Phiſitions at theyr firſt comming were of the ſame beliefe: for it hathe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, when they haue bin ſent for vnto ſuch as haue ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten this fruite, they not knowing the cauſe, and behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the vryne, by and by they miniſtred medicine to ſtaunch bloud: ſurely a thing to laugh at, to ſée the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions ſo deceyued.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mexico</hi> is as much to ſay, as a ſpring or fountayne, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the propertie of the vowell and ſpéech.</p>
               <p>Others doe affirme, that <hi>Mexico</hi> hathe his name of a more auntiente time, whoſe firſte founders were called <hi>Mexiti,</hi> for vnto this day the <hi>Indian</hi> dwellers in one ſtrete of this citie are called of <hi>Mexica.</hi> The <hi>Mexiti</hi> tooke name of their principalleſt Idoll called <hi>Mexitli,</hi> who was in as greate veneration as <hi>Vitzilopuchtli,</hi> God of the warre.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mexico</hi> is enuironed with ſwéete water, and hathe thrée wayes to come vnto it by calſey, the one is from the Weſt, and that calſey is a mile and a halfe long. Another from the North, and conteyneth thrée myles in length. Eaſtwarde the Citie hathe no entrye. But Southwarde the Calſey is ſyxe myles long, why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che was the waye that <hi>Cortez</hi> entred into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
               <p>The lake that <hi>Mexico</hi> is planted in, although it ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth one, yet it is two, for the one is of water ſaltiſhe, bitter, and peſtiferous, and no kinde of fyſhe lyueth in it. And the other water is wholeſome, good and ſwéete, and bringeth forth ſmall fiſhe.</p>
               <p>The ſalte water ebbeth and floweth, accordyng
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:9400:105"/>to the winde that bloweth. The ſwéete water ſtandeth higher, ſo that the good water falleth into the euill, and reuerteth not backward, as ſome hold opinion. The ſalt lake conteyneth fiftéene miles in breadth and fifteene in length, and more than fiue and fortie in circuite, and the lake of ſweete water conteyneth euen as muche, in ſuch ſort, that the whole lake conteyneth more than thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie leagues, and hath about fiftie townes ſcituated round about it, many of whyche Townes doe conteyne fiue thouſand houſholdes, and ſome tenne thouſande, yea and one Towne called <hi>Tezcuco,</hi> is as bigge as <hi>Mexico.</hi> Al this lake of water ſpringeth out of a Mountayne that ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth within ſight of
<hi>Mexico.</hi> The cauſe that the one part of the lake is brackiſhe or ſaltiſh, is, that the bottome or ground is all ſalte, and of that water greate quantitie of ſalt is dayly made.</p>
               <p>In this greate lake are aboue two hundred thouſande little boates, which the <hi>Indians</hi> call <hi>Acalles,</hi> and the
<hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyardes</hi> call them <hi>Canoas,</hi> according to the ſpéeche of <hi>Cuba</hi> and <hi>Santo Domingo,</hi> wrought like a kneding trough: ſome are bigger than other ſome, according to the greateneſſe of the body of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trée whereof they are made. And where I number two hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred thouſand of theſe boates, I ſpeake of the leaſt, for <hi>Mexico</hi> alone hathe aboue fiftie thouſande ordinarily to carrie and bring vnto the Citie victuall, prouiſion, and paſſengers, ſo that on the market day all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtréetes of water are full of them.</p>

<hi>Mutezuma.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This place is wide and large, compaſſed round about with dores, and is ſo great, that a hundered thouſand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons come thither to choppe and change, as a Cittie moſt principall in all that region. Wherefore the reſort is fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> farre parties vnto that place. Euery occupatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and kinde of Marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>diſe hath his proper place appointed, which no other may by any means occupy or diſturbe. Likewiſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous wares haue their place accordinglye, (that is to ſay) ſtone, timber, lyme, bricke, and all kinde of ſtuffe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought, being neceſſarie to buylde withall. Alſo mattes both fine and courſe of ſundry workemanſhip, alſo coles, woodde, and all ſorts of Earthen veſſell glazed and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted very curiouſly: Deare ſkinnes both rawe and tanned in haire and without haire, of many colours, for ſhooma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, for bucklers, Targets, Ierkins, and lyning of wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Corſelets: alſo ſkinnes of other beaſtes and foule in feathers ready dreſſed of all ſortes, the colours and ſtraungneſſe thereof was a thing to behold. The richeſt Marchandiſe was ſalte, and mantels of Cotten wolle of diuers colours, both great and ſmall, ſome for beddes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for garments and clothing, other for Tapiſſarie to hang houſes, other cotten clothe for linnen breaches, ſhirtes, table clothes, towels, napkins, and ſuche like things.</p>
               <p>There were alſo Mantels made of the leaues of the trée called <hi>Metl,</hi> and of Palme trée, &amp; Connie heare, which are wel eſtéemed, being very warm, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> couerlets made of feathers are the beſt: they ſell thréede made of Connie heare, péeces of linnen clothe made of cotten wolle, alſo <pb n="198" facs="tcp:9400:106"/>ſkaynes of thréede of all colours: alſo it is ſtraunge to ſée the great ſtore of poultrie that is brought to that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and although they eate the fleſhe of the foule, yet the feathers ſerue for clothing, mixyng one ſorte with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. There are of theſe foule ſo many ſortes and ſeuerall colours, that I can not number them: ſome wilde, ſome tame, ſome water foule, and other ſome of rapine. All the brauery of the market, is the place where golde and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ioyntly wrought is ſolde, for any thyng that is in requeſt is there liuely wrought in golde and feathers and gallant colours. The <hi>Indians</hi> are ſo expert and perfite in this ſcience, that they will worke or make a Butter flie, any wilde beaſte, trées, roſes, floures, hearbes, rootes or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other thyng ſo liuely, that it is a thyng maruelous to behold. It hapneth many tymes that one of theſe worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in a whole day will eate nothyng, onely to place one feather in his dew perfection, turnyng and toſſing the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the lighte of the Sunne, into the ſhade or darke place, to ſée where is his moſte naturall perfection, and till his worke be finiſhed he will neyther eate nor drinke. There are few nations of ſo muche fleame or ſufferance. The Arte or Science of Goldſmiths among them is the moſte curious, and very good workemanſhip engrauen with toles made of flinte, or in moulde. They will caſte a platter in moulde with eight corners, and euery corner of ſeuerall mettall, that is to ſay, the one of golde, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſiluer, without any kinde of ſowder: they will alſo founde or caſt a litle caudren with loſe handles hangyng thereat, as we vſe to caſte a Bell: they will alſo caſte in mould a fiſh of mettal with one ſcale of ſiluer on his back and another of gold: they will make a Parret or Popin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gay of mettall, that his tongue ſhall ſhake, and his head moue, &amp; his wings flutter: they wil caſte an Ape in mold, that both hands &amp; féete ſhall ſtirre, &amp; holde a ſpindle in his
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:9400:106"/>hande ſéeming to ſpinne, yea and an apple in his hande as though he would eate it. Our Spaniardes were not a litle amazed at the ſight of theſe things, for our Goldſmithes are not to be compared vnto them. They haue ſkil alſo of Amell worke, and to ſette any pretious ſtone. But now as touchyng the markette, there is to ſell Golde, Siluer, Copper, Leadde, Latton, and Tinne, although there is but little of the thrée laſte mettals mentioned. There are Pearles, Pretious ſtones, diuers and ſundry ſortes of Shelles, and Bones, Sponges, and other pedlers ware, whiche certainely are many and ſtraunge ſortes, yea and a thing to laughe at their Haberdaſhe toyes and trifles. There are alſo many kinde of hearbes, rootes, and ſéedes, as well to be eaten as for Medicine, for bothe men, we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and chyldren haue great knowledge in hearbes, for through pouertie and neceſſitie, they ſéeke them for theyr ſuſtenaunce and helpe of theyr infirmities and diſeaſes. They ſpende little among Phiſitions, although there are ſome of that Arte, and many Poticaries, who doe bryng into the markette, oyntments, Siroppes, waters, and other drugges fitte for ſicke Perſons: they cure all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes almoſt, with hearbes, yea as muche as for to kill lyſe they haue a proper hearbe for the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The ſeuerall kyndes of meates to be ſolde is without number, as Snakes without head &amp; tayle, little Dogges gelte, Moules, Rattes, Long wormes, Lyſe, yea and a kinde of earth, for at one ſeaſon in the yiere they haue Nettes of mayle with the which they rake vp a certayne duſte that is bredde vpon the water of the lake of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and that is knéeded togither like vnto oas of the ſea: they gather much of this victuall, &amp; kéepe it in heapes, &amp; make therof cakes like vnto brickebats: they ſell not only this ware in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> market, but alſo ſend it abroad to other fayres &amp; markets a far of: they eat this meate w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as good ſtomake <pb n="200" facs="tcp:9400:107"/>as we eate chéeſe, yea and they holde opinion that this ſku<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me or fatneſſe of the water, is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe that ſuch great number of foule co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to the lake, which in the winter ſeaſon is infinite.</p>
               <p>They ſel in this market veniſon by quarters or whole, as Does, Hares, Connies, and Dogges, and many other beaſtes, whiche they bring vp for the purpoſe, and take in huntyng. There are a great number of ſhoppes that ſell all kinde of orfall and tripes. It is a wonder to ſée how ſo much meate ready dreſſed coulde be ſpent. There is alſo fleſhe and fiſhe roſted, boyled and baked, Pies and Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtardes made of diuers ſortes of egges, the great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of bread is without number. Alſo corne of all ſortes threſhed and vnthreſhed. The greate ſtore of ſundry kyndes of fruytes is maruellous whiche are there ſolde, bothe gréene and ripe: there is one ſorte as bigge as Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondes called
<hi>Cacao,</hi> whiche is bothe meate and curxant money. There are diuers kind of colours to be ſolde, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che they make of Roſes, floures, fruites, barkes of trées, and other things very excellent: they ſell there Honie of ſundry kindes, oyle of <hi>Chian,</hi> made of a ſéede like vnto mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarde ſéede, and oynting any paynted clothe therewith, the water can not hurte it, they alſo dreſſe ther with their meate, although they haue both butter and larde. Theyr ſundry ſortes of wines ſhalbe declared in an other plate: it woulde be a prolirious thing to rehearſe all the things that are to be ſolde in that markette. There are in this fayre many Artificers, as Packers, Barbars, Cutlers, &amp; many others, although it was thought that among theſe <hi>Indians</hi> were none ſuch.

               <p>Our almighty God after he had finiſhed and made all the former workes with his own bleſſed hands, made one man &amp; one woman, and being ſo formed and wrought, he put a ſoule and breath into each body, and then deliuered the worlde vnto them, ſhewyng them Paradiſe and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

Therefore I ſay vnto you, that nowe and hereafter there is no cauſe that yée ſhoulde haue any moe idolles, nor yet any moe ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for ſacrifice, no nor yet to make any moe prayers or ſupplications vnto them, beyng bothe Blinde, Deafe, and Dumme.</p>

               <p>An other cauſe was that the Diuell had appeared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and willed him to kill thoſe Chriſtians, or dryue them out of the lande, threatnyng him that if he did not ſo, that then he woulde goe from him and neuer talke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more with him, for (quoth he) with their goſpels, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme and deuotion, they doe muche diſpleaſe me. <hi>Mute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zuma</hi> anſwered him, that there was no reaſon to kill the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being his friendes and honeſt men, but he would entreate them to departe, (vnto this) the Diuell anſwered that hée ſhould do ſo, and therein he would receyue great pleaſure, for eyther he woulde goe his way and leaue him, or elſe that Chriſtian fellowes ſhould departe, for they ſow here (quoth he) a Chriſtian fayth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which is much againſt our Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and can not dwell both togither.

<hi>Mutezuma</hi> aroſe from the place where hée ſate, and tooke

Remember alſo whome ye are, and who are theſe Infidels, abhorred of God, and friends vnto the Diuel, without weapon, and experience in warre: if we chance to fight, the handes of each of vs ſhal ſhew by déede with ſword, the vallor and courage of our heartes: yea, and although we all die, yet ſhall we remaine with victory, for that we haue fulfilled the thing we tooke in hand, and the ſeruice which we owe vnto God as faithfull Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, with our duetie as true ſubiects to our prince.

               <p>
                  <hi>Cortez</hi> anſwered, not knowing of that ſhipping, ſaying, Mightie Sir, when my Shippes are finiſhed I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, nay (quoth <hi>Mutezuma</hi>) I meane not thoſe Shyppes, for there are ariued eleuen other Shippes at the coaſt néere vnto <hi>Zempoallan,</hi> and ſhortlye I ſhall be certifyed, whether the people that are come in them, are come a ſhore, and then ſhall we know what people, and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny they are in number. Bleſſed is Ieſu Chriſte (quoth <hi>Cortez</hi>) vnto whome I giue moſt hartie thankes for his great mercies ſhewed vnto me, and to the Gentlemen of my company. One of <hi>Cortes</hi> his men went to ſhewe the glad tidings to their fellowes, who then receyued double ſtrength, prayſing God, and embraced one another wyth great pleaſure and ioy. And
<hi>Cortes</hi> with <hi>Mutezuma</hi> bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in communication togither, came another poaſt, who broughte newes of foureſcore Horſemen that were lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, with eyght humdred footemen, and twelue péeces of Ordinance,

                  <hi>Mutezuma</hi> hearing the newes that this poaſt hadde broughte, aroſe from his ſeate, and tooke <hi>Cortes</hi> in hys armes, ſaying, now do I more loue you, than I haue done héeretofore, and will this day dyne with you. <hi>Cortes</hi> gaue him thankes for the one and the other, and in this ſorte wente hande in hand to <hi>Cortes</hi> his Chamber, who willed his Spanyards not to make any extraordinary ioy, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, but that they ſhoulde kéepe all togither with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant watche, and to giue hartie thankes vnto God for the comfortable newes. <hi>Mutezuma</hi> and

               <p>With this counſell <hi>Mutezuma</hi> called many his friends and chiefe eſtates to counſell, propounding the caſe and iudgement of the Captaine, whych béeyng among them throughly hearde, there were many of ſundrye opinions,
<note place="margin">A drunken reckoning.</note> but the concluſion was, to permitte the other Spanyards to come, ſaying, the more enimies, the more gaine, and if we kill but thoſe whiche are héere, then the others wyll returne to their ſhippes, and ſo ſhall we not make the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne ſacrifice of them to the Gods, according to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.
<hi>Mutezuma</hi> was occupyed in this counſell with fiue hundred noblemen and Gentlemen dayly, and accordyng to determination, they commaunded to cheriſh and ſerue <hi>Cortes</hi> and his company more than ordinary, ſaying their ioy was at an ende.</p>

               <p>But the chiefeſt and moſt principall cauſe was; that after the departure of <hi>Cortes</hi> towarde <hi>Naruaez,</hi> happened a ſolemne holiday, whiche the <hi>Mexicans</hi> were wont to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate, and deſiring to obſerue the ſame, as they were wont to do, they came and beſoughte Captayne <hi>Aluarado</hi> to graunt them licence, &amp; not to ymagine that they were ioyned togither, to kill the Spanyardes. <hi>Aluarado</hi> gaue them licence, with ſuch conditions, that in their Sacrifice ſhoulde no mans bloude be ſpilte, nor yet to weare anye weapon.</p>

               <p>

Againe, he knewe well that their meaning was, that if they hadde departed from the Citie, to haue ſpoyled and murthered them by the way. And ſéeing that their liues, rule and gouernement conſiſted in ſtrength of hand and good courage, he came forth in a morning with the thrée engines, foure péeces of Ordinance, and fiue hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

They broughte the engines néere vnto certaine greate houſes whiche ſtoode néere vnto a bridge, caſting theyr ſcaling ladders on the walles, and ſo gote vp to the toppe where manye people were, and there combated awhile, but ſhortly turned to their forte againe, without doing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny greate hurte, with one Spanyarde ſlayne, and manye wounded, and alſo the engines broken and ſpoyled, yea the multitude of <hi>Indians</hi> were ſo thicke, and flewe vppon the Ordinance in ſuche ſorte, that they had no leyſure to diſcharge them. The ſtones came alſo ſo thicke from the houſe toppes, that the engines were ſoone at an ende. And the Citizens hauing houſed them againe in the forte and lodging, began to amende the hurt done in their houſes, and to recouer the ſtréetes that were loſt: alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great <pb n="270" facs="tcp:9400:142"/>Temple, in the Tower whereof, fiue hundred principall men hadde fortifyed themſelues wyth vittayles, ſtones, and long Launces, piked with yron and flint ſtone verye ſharp, but truly they did moſt hurt with ſtones. This Tower was high and ſtrong, as I haue before declared, and ſtoode néere vnto the Spanyardes forte, whiche from that tower receiued muche hurt. Although <hi>Cortes</hi> was ſomewhat ſadde and heauie, yet he ceaſſed not like a good Captayne to comfort and encourage his menne, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes was the firſte man at any brunt or aſſay, and hys heart coulde not permitte him to remaine penned vp in that ſort, wherefore he toke thrée hundred Spanyardes, and went to aſſiege the high tower. Thrée or foure dayes he ceaſſed not that enterpriſe, but coulde not come to the toppe, being ſo high a thing, and manye perſons in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the ſame, well prouided, with fitte munition for the purpoſe, ſo that our men came dayly tumbling downe the ſtayres, flying to their houſe with broken pates, ſo that our Spanyardes dyſmayed more and more, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny murmured at the matter: you may well iudge howe <hi>Cortes</hi> his heart was afflighted, for the <hi>Indians</hi> encreaſed ſtill in courage, hauing the better hand, and dayly victory from the high Tower.

In this communications the daye was ſpente, and night at hand, their heads occupyed, and heartes full heauie, for hunger alone hadde bin ynough to finiſh theyr dayes, without any further warre.

<hi>Indians</hi> had not occupied themſelues in taking the ſpoyle of thoſe that were fallen and ſlaine, certenly one Chriſtian had not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped that day: but in fine, the greateſt number of Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes that were killed, were thoſe that went moſte laden with golde plate and other iewels, &amp; thoſe whiche eſcaped, were they that carried leaſt burdens, &amp; the firſt that with noble courage made way to paſſe through the troupe of <hi>Indians.</hi>

What nation is there, that had rule, dominon, and Empire in this world, that hath not bin o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome at ſome time? What famous Captayne retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned home to his houſe, for the loſſe of one battayle? none truly, for he that dothe not perſeuer, ſhall neuer triumph with Lady Victory: he that retyreth, ſheweth that he fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and remayneth a mocking ſtocke for all men: but hée that ſheweth nobly his face, dothe vtter the courage of his heart, yea and is both feared, and alſo beloued.</p>
               <p>If we now ſhould depart from hence, theſe our frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds would accept and iudge vs for cowardes, and refuſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually our friendſhip.

               <p>I doe muche maruell at the greateneſſe of your inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible heartes in battell: you were wont to be deſirous of warres, and nowe that ſuche iuſt and laudable warre doth offer it ſelfe, you doe feare and refuſe the ſame: ſure it is a thing cleane contrary to oure nature. What is hée that will prate of harnes, and neuer ware none? It was neuer yet ſéene in all this <hi>India</hi> and new world, that any of our nation retired with feare. And woulde you nowe that it ſhould be ſaid, that

Therefore you may well conſider, that héere you are more ſure than if you were from hence, ſo that héere in
<hi>Tlaxcallan</hi> you are honored with ſecuritie and ſtrength, and beſides this, you haue al things neceſſary of phiſicke and medicine to cure youre woundes and obteyne your health: yea, and I am bolde to ſaye, that if you were in youre owne naturall Countrey, you ſhoulde not haue the like, nor yet ſo much made off.</p>

               <p>Beſides all this, they committe that horrible ſinne for the whiche the fiue cities with <hi>Sodom</hi> were burned by fire from heauen: Why then what greater occaſion ſhould any man wiſhe for in earth, than to aboliſh ſuch wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and to plant among theſe bloudy tirants the fayth of Ieſu Chriſt, publiſhing his holy goſpel?

<hi>Cortes</hi> his mercy, and if not, yet it were more honorable to fight than to bragge, willyng them to come out into the field. And bad them aſſuredly beléeue, that the ende of all their knauery was at hande: it was a world to heare and ſée the bragges and crakes on both ſides.
<hi>Cortes</hi> hearyng of all theſe matters, ſent <hi>Sandoual</hi> to take <hi>Iztacpalapan,</hi> and he enbarked himſelfe to méete him at that place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sandoual</hi> combated the towne on the one ſide, and the townes menne and people with feare fledde vnto <hi>Mexico,</hi> on the otherſide by water: he burned the towne. <hi>Cortes</hi> came at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time to a ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g rocke lyke a tower, ſituated in the water, where many men of

It was a fayre victorie, although fiue and twentie Spanyardes were hurte and wounded, yet the forte was ſtrong, and the ouerthrowe a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragyng of the enimie.</p>
               <p>At this inſtant were ſo many beacons and other fires made rounde aboute the lake and vpon the hilles, that all ſéemed a lighte fire.

But it followed, that when they came within ſhotte of the Spaniardes ordinaunce: they ſtayed aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng more company, but in ſhorte ſpace there came ſo many <hi>Canoas,</hi> that it ſéemed a wonder to beholde: They made ſuche a terrible noyſe with theyr voyces, drummes, Snayle ſhelles, and other like inſtruments of warre, that they could not heare one an other, with ſuch great crakes and bragges, as they had done in time paſte.</p>
               <p>And beyng bothe parties in a readineſſe to fight, there happened ſuche a poupewinde to the Vergantines which came from the ſhore, that it ſéemed meruellous. <hi>Cortes</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prayſing God, commaunded al his Captaines to giue the onſet altogithers, &amp; not to ceaſſe vntill the enimies ſhould be dryuen to retire into

Our army procéedyng forward, ſet vppon the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimies, vntill they came to another bridge, the whyche was likewiſe wonne in ſhorte time, and this purſued from bridge to bridge, alwayes fighting, vntill they had driuen them from the Calſey and ſtréetes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cortes</hi> for his part loſt no time, for he with tenne thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande <hi>Indians</hi> laboured to damme vp againe the ſluſes and broken places of the bridges, making the way plaine both for Horſemen and footemen: it was ſo much to doe, that all thoſe ten thouſand
<hi>Indians</hi> were occupyed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in from the morning vntill the euening.</p>
               <p>The other Spanyards and <hi>Indian</hi> friends ſkirmiſhed continually, and ſlew many of their enimies. Likewyſe the Horſemen ſo ſcoured the ſtréetes, that the enimies were forced to locke them vp in their houſes &amp; Temples. It was a notable thing to ſée how our
<hi>Indians</hi> played the menne that daye againſte the Citizens: ſometimes they would chalenge them the fielde: other times they would conuite them to ſupper, and ſhewe vnto them legges, armes, and other péeces of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s fleſh, ſaying behold your owne fleſh which ſhal ſerue for our ſupper and brekefaſt, and to morrow we wil come for more, therefore flye not, <pb n="328" facs="tcp:9400:171"/>you are valiant fellowes, yet it were better for you to dye fighting than with hunger. And after all this ſpéech, euery one of them called vppon the name of his owne Towne with a loude voyce, ſetting fire vppon their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. The <hi>Mexicans</hi> were repleniſhed with ſorrow, to ſee themſelues ſo afflicted with Spanyardes, but yet theyr ſorrowe was the greater, to heare their owne vaſſals ſo raile againſte them, ſaying and crying at their owne dores, victory, victory,
<hi>Tlaxcallan, Chalcho, Tezcuco, Xoch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milco,</hi> and other Townes: the eating of their fleſhe gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them not, for they did the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cortes</hi> ſéeing the <hi>Mexicans</hi> ſo ſtoute and hard harted, with full determination eyther to defend themſelues or elſe to dye, therevpon he bethought himſelfe vppon two things, the one was, that he ſhoulde not obteyne the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure whiche he had ſéene in the time of <hi>Mutezuma:</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was, that they gaue him occaſion totally to deſtroy the Citie. Both theſe things gréeued him much, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the citie. He ymagined with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe what he mighte doe, to bring them to acknowledge their error, and the hurt that mighte fall vpon them, and for theſe conſiderations he pluckt downe their Towers, and brake their idolles. He burned alſo the greate houſe wherein he was lodged before, and the houſe of foule which was néere at ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. There was not one Spanyard who had ſéene that magnificall building before, but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented ſore the ſight: but to agréeue the Citizens, it was commaunded to be burned. There was neuer <hi>Mexican,</hi> that thought any humaine force, how much leſſe ſo fewe Spanyards, ſhoulde haue entred into <hi>Mexico</hi> in deſpite of them all, and to ſette fire vpon their principalleſt edifices within the Citie. While this houſe was a burning, <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> gathered his men, and retired to his Campe. The
<hi>Mexicans</hi> would fayne haue remedyed the fire, but it was
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:9400:171"/>too late, and ſéeing our men retire, they followed wyth their noyſe accuſtomed, and ſlue ſome of our men, who were laden with the ſpoyle, and came behinde the reſte. The horſmen relieued our men, and cauſed the enimy to retire, in ſuch wiſe, that before night al our men werein ſafetie and the enimies in their houſes, the one ſorte full of ſorowe, and the others wearied with fighte and trauel. The ſlaughter was great that day, but the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and ſpoyle of houſes was greater, for beſides thoſe whiche wee haue ſpoken of, the Vergantines did the like where they wente, and the other Captaines alſo were not idle where they were appointed.</p>

All this policie was but to féele what ſtrength and courage our menne had, and to haue truce for a certayne time, for to prouide them of ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries as they wanted, for their determinate purpoſe was, to dye in the defence of their countrey and religion. <hi>Cortes</hi> aunſwered, that truce was not conueniente for ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther partie, but peace was laudable at al times, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che for his parte, although he hadde beſéeged the Citie, ſhould not be denyed: therfore he willed them to wey his plentifull eſtate of vittayles, and their owne néede and neceſſitie of the ſame. They being in this communication with their interpreters, appeared an auntient olde man on the toppe of the Bulwarke, who in the ſighte of them all, pluckt bread out of his ſatchell péece by péece, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to eate, giuing them to vnderſtand, that they ſtoode in no néede of vittayles, and ſo made an ende of theyr talke.</p>
               <p>The ſéege of this Citie ſéemed a long time to

               <p>Yet once agayne he ſente this laſt meſſage vnto them, that if they woulde not yéelde themſelues, then he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them enuironed by land and water, woulde ſlea the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, and not permitte anye kinde of victuall to come vnto them, ſo that theyr extremitie ſhoulde be ſo greate, that they ſhould eate one another: their aunſwere was, that firſte the Spanyardes ſhoulde taſt of the ſame cuppe, ſo that threatning increaſed their courages, and occupyed themſelues in carrying ſtones to the market place, and many other ſtréetes, to ſtoppe the way againſt the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and their maiſters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cortes,</hi> although it gréeued him to deſtroy totally ſo beautifull a Citie, yet he determined to bring all the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the ſtréetes that he ſhould winne to be equall with the ground, and to ſtoppe with them the Chanels of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

                  <hi>Cortes</hi> ſéeyng the towardneſſe of all his armye, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and prepared all his labourers, with their pikeaxes and ſhouels, ſo that in theſe affaires, and in ſetting hys men in good order, he ſpent foure dayes, and then he bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bate the ſtréete, which goeth directly to the market place, then fainedly the Citize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s deſired peace. <hi>Cortes</hi> ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and aſked for their King: they aunſwered, that they had ſent for him, wherevpon <hi>Cortes</hi> taried an houre, and then they began to reuile him, and to throwe ſtones, and ſhot at him. The Spanyards ſéeing this, gaue the onſet,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:9400:176"/>and wanne a forte, and came into the chiefe place of the Citie. They cleanſed the ſtréetes of the ſtones whiche they had laide to diſturbe their paſſage, and ſtopped ſo vp the water ſtréete in that place, in ſuche wiſe, that neuer after it was opened againe, and threw downe all the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, making the entrance into the Citie an open playne high way, and then retired to their camp.

               <p>As ſoone as any King of <hi>Mexico</hi> deceaſſed, and his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals ended, then were called to Parliamente the Lorde of <hi>Tezcuco,</hi> and the Lorde of <hi>Tlacopan,</hi> who were the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt eſtates, and then in order all other noble men, who owed any ſeruice to the Mexican Empire. And béeyng come togither, if any doubt of the inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crowne happened, then the matter was decided with al haſt: then the newe King being knowen, he was ſtripped ſtarke na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, except a cloth to couer his priuie partes, and in thys ſorte was carried among them, to the greate Temple
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:9400:197"/>of <hi>Vitzilopuchtli</hi> with greate ſilence, and without any ioy or pleaſure: Two Gentlemen of the Citie whoſe office it was, ledde him vppe the ſtaires of the Temple by the armes, and before him wente the Princes of <hi>Tezcuco</hi> and <hi>Tlacopan,</hi> who that day did weare their robes of Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherevpon was paynted their armes and title. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye fewe of the Laytie wente vp into the Chappels, but only thoſe that were appoynted to attire the newe king, and to ſerue in other Ceremonies, for all the reſidue ſtoode vpon the ſteppes and belowe, to beholde the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Theſe Magiſtrates being aboue in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, came with great humilitie and reuerence, knéelyng downe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their knées before the Idoll of <hi>Vitzilopuchtl,</hi> and touched the earth with one finger and then kiſſed the ſame. Then came the high prieſte clothed in his pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call veſtmentes, with many others in his company, who did weare ſurplices: and withoute ſpeaking any worde, they paynted or couloured the Kings perſon,
<note place="margin">The oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> with ynke made for the purpoſe, as blacke as any cole. After thys Ceremonye done, they bleſſed the annoynted Kyng, and ſprinckled him foure times with a certayne holly water, that was made at the time of conſecration of the God, made of dowe or paſte, with a ſprinckle made of boughes of Cane leaues, Ceder, &amp; willow leaues. Then they put vpon his head, a cloth painted with the bones and ſkulles of dead men, and next they clothed him with a black gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> another blewe, and both were paynted with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> figures of dead mens ſkulles &amp; bones. Then they put about his necke certaine laces, whereat did hang the armes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Crowne. And behind his backe they did hang certain little bottels ful of powders, by vertue wherof he was deliuered from peſtilence and diſeaſes, according to their opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: yea &amp; therby witches, nor witchcrafts could not hurt him, nor yet euill menne deceyue him.

Vpon his lefte arme they bounde a litle bagge of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, and then brought vnto him a chaffyng diſhe of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers made of the barke of an Oke trée. Then the king a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, and with his owne hande threw of the ſame incenſe into the chaffing diſhe, and with great reuerence brought the ſame to the God <hi>Vitzilopuchtli,</hi> and after he had ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him therewith, he ſatte him downe, then came the high Prieſt and tooke his othe to mainteyne the religion of the Goddes, to kéepe alſo all the lawes and cuſtomes of his predeceſſours, to maynteyne iuſtice, and not to agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiate any of his vaſſals or ſubiects, and that he ſhould be valiant in the warres, that he ſhoulde cauſe the Sunne to giue his light, the clowdes to yéelde rayne, the riuers to runne, and the earth to bring foorth all kinde of grayne, fruytes, and other néedefull hearbes and trées. Theſe and many other impoſſible things the newe kyng did ſweare to performe: and then he gaue thankes to the high prieſt, and commended himſelf to the Goddes and to the lookers on, and they who brought him vp in the ſame order, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth him downe agayne. Then all the people cried, the Goddes preſerue the newe kyng, and that he may raigne many yéeres in health with al his people. But then ſome began to daunce, other to play on their inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing outwardly their inwarde ioyes of harte. And before the king came to the foote of the ſteppes, all the noble men came to yéelde their obedience, and in token of louing and faythfull ſubiectes they preſented vnto him feathers, ſtrings of ſnayle ſhelles, collours, and other Iewelles of golde and ſiluer, alſo mantels paynted with death, &amp; bare him company vnto a great hal within the compaſſe of the temple, and there lefte him.

They placed about the dead body of the King before his buriall, Roſes, Floures and ſundry diſhes of meate and drinke, and no creature durſte touche the ſame, but onely y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prieſts, for it ſéemed to be an offeryng.</p>
               <p>The nexte day followyng, all the aſhes were gathered togither, and the téeth with the Emerald that was in his mouth, the whiche things were put into a cheſt, paynted on the inſide with horrible figures of diuels, and the locke of heare whiche was cut from his crowne, and another locke of heare which was preſerued from the tyme of his birth. Then the cheſt was lockte, and an image of wood made and clothed like vnto the Kings perſon, which was ſet on the toppe of the cheſt. The obſequies endured foure dayes, in the whiche the wines and daughters of the king offered great offerings at the place where his body was buried, and before the cheſt and his image.</p>
               <p>On the fourth day after the buriall, fiftene ſlaues were ſacrificed for his ſoule, and on the twentith day o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fiue perſons were alſo ſacrificed, likewiſe on the ſixtie thrée, and foureſcore, whiche was lyke vnto the yéeres minde.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N <hi>Mexico</hi> were twelue Iudges, who were all noble men, graue, and well learned in the Mexican lawes.

The Painters ſerued for notaries, to paint al the caſes which were to be reſolued, but no ſute paſſed aboue foureſcore dayes without finall ende and determination. There were in that citie twelue Sergeants, whoſe office was to arreſt, and to cal parties before the Iudges. Their garments were painted man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, wherby they were knowen a farre off. The priſons were vnder ground, moyſt and darke, the cauſe whereof, was to put the people in feare to offend. If anye witneſſe were called to take an oth, the order was, that he ſhoulde touche the grounde with one of his fingers, and then to touch his tong with the ſame, whiche ſignifyed that hée had ſworne and promiſed to ſpeake the troth wyth hys to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, taking witnes therof, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth which did mainteine him.

               <p>The Iudge that taketh bribes or giftes, is forthwith put out of his office, whiche was accounted a moſt vyle and ſhamefull reproch. The

               <p>The woman with child that wilfully caſteth hir crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſuffereth deathe for the ſame, bycauſe many women did voluntary vſe that fact, knowing their children could not inherite. The puniſhment of adultery was death.</p>
               <p>The Théefe for the firſte offence was made a ſlaue, and hanged for the ſecond. The traytor to the King and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale, was put to death with extreame torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.</p>
               <p>The woman taken in mans apparel dyed for the ſame, and likewiſe the man taken in womans attire.

And being open in the backe part and ſhoulders, they vſed to lace them, in ſuch ſorte that they came fitte vppon the bodies of thoſe that ware them, and being in this order attired, they came to daunce among many others.

               <p>The ſlaues when they went to their ſacrifice, were apparelled in the habite or deuiſe of the Idol vnto whom ech of them did commende himſelfe: and moreouer they decked them with feathers, garlands and floures.

               <p>The feaſte of <hi>Tozoztli</hi> was, when the fields of

                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>N the backe ſide of euerye greate Temple, in euerye Cittie was made a greate Hall or lodgyng, ſtanding alone, where as manye women did eate, drincke, lodge, &amp; leade their liues. And although ſuche houſes had no orders, they aboad there ſure ynough. Theſe women which lay in the houſes of the Goddes, were of ſundry intentions. But none of them came to abide there al their life time, although among them wer ſome olde women. Some entered into thoſe religious houſes being ſicke and diſſeaſed, hoping there to recouer theyr health: others came thither through pure néede, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, to be there relieued: other ſome came thither to be good and vertuous: and ſome entered into the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hoping that the Goddes woulde giue vnto them riches, and long life. But generallye their comming thyther was, to haue good huſbandes, and manye chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: eche of them vowed the time that ſhee woulde or ment to abide in that order, and after that time expired they marryed.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing that they did comming into the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, was to polle their heads, to be knowen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> others. <pb n="397" facs="tcp:9400:205"/>Their offices were to ſpinne cotton wool and feathers, and to weaue cloth, for to apparel the Goddes and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, to ſwepe the yarde and lodgings of the temple (for the ſtayres and high chappels, the miniſters themſelues did make cleane) they vſed alſo to let them bloud in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine partes of the body, to offer to the Diuelliſh Idols. On euery feſtiual day they went on proceſſion with the prieſtes, but it was not lawful for them to preſume to go vppe the ſtayres of the temple, nor yet to ſing. They li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued on almes, for their kinſefolke being rich, did mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them with almes as a charitable ſeruice done vnto the Goddes: their foode was boyled fleſh, and hote bread, to the intent that they ſhould offer therof to the Goddes, that they might taſt of the ſmoke of that victual: they v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to eate in communitie, and lay altogither in one dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitorye, as a flocke of ſhéepe: they lay alwayes in theyr clothes, for honeſtie ſake, and alſo to be the ſooner ready in the morning to ſerue the Gods, &amp; to go to their worke. And yet I know not why they ſhold put off their clothes, for they went almoſt naked. On the holy dayes they vſed to daunce before the Gods, and ſhe that either talked or laughed with any religious or ſecular perſon, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended for the ſame. And if any of them committed whoredome, then both the man &amp; the woman were ſlain, yea they belieued that all ſuche offenders fleſhe woulde rotte and conſume away, and eſpecially thoſe which had loſt their Virginity in the time of their religion. So that with feare of puniſhmente and infamie, they were good women al the while that they aboade there.</p>
